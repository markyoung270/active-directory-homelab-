I chose Hyper-V because it's well established on Windows 11 Professional Edition, my host OS.
The virtual machine I created has 6gb of RAM allocated, as well as 124gb of disk space.
Virtualiztion is integral to this project due to the ability to establish a server without additional hardware, in a sandbox environment
perfect for learning and correcting any mistakes.
Initially, upon setup, I didn't have an ISO attached to my boot process, upon correction I was able to successfully set up and
initialize my server.
