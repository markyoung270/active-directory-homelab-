I chose Hyper-V as my virtualization platform because it is natively supported on Windows 11 Professional, which is my host operating system.
This allowed me to build and manage virtual machines without needing additional third-party software.

For this lab, I allocated 6 GB of RAM and 124 GB of storage to the virtual machine to ensure the server would have
sufficient resources to run smoothly while leaving adequate capacity for future updates and configuration changes.

Virtualization is integral to this project because it enables me to create a realistic server environment without requiring additional physical hardware.
This sandboxed setup allows me to safely experiment, make configuration changes,
and troubleshoot issues without risking my primary system, making it an ideal learning environment.
