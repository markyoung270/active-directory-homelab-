I chose Hyper-V because it's well established on Windows 11 Professional Edition, my host OS.

The virtual machine I created has 6gb of RAM allocated, as well as 124gb of disk space.

Virtualization is integral to this project due to the ability to establish a server without additional hardware, in a sandbox environment
perfect for learning and correcting any mistakes.
