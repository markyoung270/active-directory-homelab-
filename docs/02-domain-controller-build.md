Initally I attempted to load the virtual machine without an ISO. I downloaded the appropriate
Windows Server 2022 ISO and attached the ISO to DVD media, and ensured that DVD was first in the
boot order.

I choose Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience) in order to gain experience with the
Active Directory GUI, as well as properly document my steps in my repository.

I preformed a custom install (rather than upgrade) for a clean and predictable install of a new
server.

I the logged in to see the Server Manager screen and explored options for installing roles, managing
server features, and I viewed the events/services currently running.
