This lab was created to gain hands-on experience with building and configuring an Active Directory environment.
The purpose of the project is to develop practical skills in user management, policy application, and centralized identity administration.
By completing this lab, I wanted to better understand how Active Directory is used in real enterprise settings and prepare myself for entry-level IT roles.
